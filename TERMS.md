1. **Scope**: The add-on is provided to assist administrators with identifying and managing risky external file sharing in Google Workspace.
2. **Acceptable Use**: Do not use the add-on to access files you don't have permission to view or to violate Google's terms for Workspace add-ons.

4. **Admin Privileges**: This add-on requires domain admin privileges. Only authorized administrators should install and use this add-on.

7. **Availability**: The add-on is provided "as is" without uptime guarantees. Performance depends on Drive API limits.
8. **Warranty & Liability**: Provided without warranty. Use at your own risk; authors are not liable for damages arising from use or permission modifications.
9. **Support**: Community support is available via the repository issues page.
10. **Changes**: Terms and functionality may change; continued use constitutes acceptance of updates.
