# Privacy Policy

External Share Risk Monitor is a Google Workspace add-on that helps administrators identify and manage risky external file sharing.

- **Data Access**: The add-on reads file metadata (names, permissions, owners, links) from Google Drive to identify external shares. No file content is accessed or stored.
- **Data Storage**: Risk reports and scan results are stored in Script Properties. No file content is stored permanently.
- **Data Sharing**: No data is sent to or shared with third parties. All processing happens within Google's infrastructure.
- **Admin Access**: This add-on requires domain admin privileges to access Drive information across the organization.
- **Logging**: Operational logs are written to Apps Script Logger for troubleshooting. Remediation actions are logged for audit purposes.
- **Removal**: Remove stored reports and settings by uninstalling the add-on or clearing Script Properties.
- **Support**: For privacy questions, open an issue in the repository or contact support@tangentforge.com.
